*DESCRIPTION* :
I have used Visual Studio Code Editor for my Python project which fetches real-time weather data for 10 major Indian cities using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it through easy to understand visualizations. It collects temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather details, organizes them into a clean table using pandas, and creates four colorful charts in one view: a line graph showing city-wise temperatures, a bar chart comparing humidity levels, a scatter plot exploring temperature-humidity relationships, and a box plot analyzing wind speed variations. Built with Python libraries like requests (for API calls), pandas (for data handling), and seaborn/matplotlib (for visuals), the project demonstrates how raw weather data can be transformed into meaningful insights. The charts use clear labels, markers, and grid layouts to highlight trends—like which cities are hottest or most humid—while the code structure makes it simple to add more locations or weather parameters. Perfect for beginners learning API integration or data visualization, this project mimics real-world applications like travel planning tools or weather dashboards, teaching essential skills like processing JSON API responses, structuring data efficiently, and creating professional-quality graphs with customization options for colors, fonts, and layouts. The end result is a compact yet powerful tool that turns complex weather statistics into visual stories, helping users quickly compare climate conditions across different cities.
